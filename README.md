#### Benefits Of Cloud Based Library Management Software
 find out how institutions can automate his library and blow off steam easily-
 
 
 #### Catalogue & Organize Thousands Of Books At Once
Just think for a minute – what are the tasks that you need to perform every day in the library?

By “tasks” I mean everything including sending quotations to book vendors, generating barcodes, cataloguing, organizing the books as per their author, title, name, and much more, issuing books, taking the returned books, managing records, generating & analyzing library MIS reports.

just calculate how much time you are wasting when you get the power to automate these daily in-house library functions! Probably 5-6 hours are being wasted in “simple” manual tasks that can be automated with a school ERP software integrated with the library management system. 

#### What is need?
Since, in the post-Covid transition phase, edTech has become a necessity rather than a luxury for most of the educational institutions.

And, since traditional teaching-learning classroom methods are being replaced with e-learning classes, having an outdated library management system is a bad idea. Threrfore we need cloud based library management software that can enable following –

  24*7 work from anytime & anywhere!

It will enable you to offer access to the best e-books and journals for students at their convenience.
